# TypeCheat
A JS script to cheat on certain online typing tests.

## Supported sites
As of now, the sites that work are:
- [10FastFingers](https://10fastfingers.com/)
<!-- - [Ratatype](https://www.ratatype.com/) -->
<!-- ^^^WIP^^^ -->
- [TypingTestNow](https://typingtestnow.com/)

I am planning to add support for more.

## Use
0. Ensure that you're on a supported site
1. Copy [the contents of `typecheat.min.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MysteryBlokHed/TypeCheat/master/typecheat.min.js).
2. Open the developer console (Ctrl+Shift+J on Chrome/Chromium Edge)
3. Paste the code
4. The text box will start to autofill the next words as they appear. Simply press `space` as fast as you would like, and the next words will appear as you do.

**Note: On 10FastFingers, if you end up going through the entire text, the words will continue to autofill. If you continue to press space it can cause you to get incorrect words marked, despite the text being over.**
